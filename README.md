# Flood-Segmentation-and-Prediction-using-U-Net-CNN-Model

This repository applies a version of U-Net CNN model for Flood prediction using images from drones. It is an exmaple of application of deep learning models for remote sensing datasets. 
This project has been inspired from the github repository: https://github.com/prodramp/DeepWorks/tree/main/DL-SatelliteImagery
