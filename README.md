# Flood-Segmentation-and-Prediction-using-U-Net-CNN-Model

This repository applies a version of the U-Net CNN model for Flood prediction using drone images. It is an example of applying deep learning models for remote sensing datasets. 
The dataset for the analysis has been obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/faizalkarim/flood-area-segmentation 
This project has been inspired by the GitHub repository: https://github.com/prodramp/DeepWorks/tree/main/DL-SatelliteImagery
